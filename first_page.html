        <h1 style="font-weight: lighter;">Hello Welcome to my page. </h1>
        <p>My name is 
            Bryan Gonzalez. I'm 26 years old and I'm a current student at coding temple.
            Born in Bogota, Colombia. I came to the United States at 4 years old and have
            lived here ever since then. I'm grateful for this country and what it has given me.
            I hope to become a role model one day for other people and those with a lack of
            direction in life. I want to shoot for the skies and become very good at what I'm 
            interested in. If you want to learn more about my interests, click the button  below!
            Anyways, I currently live in New York City, and have gone to school here from kindegarten
            to 12th grade. I recently graduated from the City College of New York with a Bachelors
            of Science Degree in Physics.
